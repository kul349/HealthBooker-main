The Doctor Appointment System is a web application built using React. It provides a platform for patients to schedule appointments with doctors online. The system includes features such as:

- **User Registration:** Patients can create accounts to manage their appointments.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can view doctors' availability and schedule appointments based on their preferred date and time.
- **Doctor Management:** Doctors can manage their availability and view their appointment schedules.
- **Notifications:** Users receive notifications for appointment reminders and updates.

This project aims to simplify the process of booking appointments with healthcare providers and improve the overall user experience for both patients and doctors.
